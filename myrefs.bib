	abstract = {Total variation methods and similar approaches based on regularizations with ℓ 1-type norms (and seminorms) have become a very popular tool in image processing and inverse problems due to peculiar features that cannot be realized with smooth regularizations. In particular total variation techniques had particular success due to their ability to realize cartoon-type reconstructions with sharp edges. Due to an explosion of new developments in this field within the last decade it is a difficult task to keep an overview of the major results in analysis, the computational schemes, and the application fields. With these lectures we attempt to provide such an overview, of course biased by our major lines of research. We are focusing on the basic analysis of total variation methods and the extension of the original ROF-denoising model due various application fields. Furthermore we provide a brief discussion of state-of-the art computational methods and give an outlook to applications in different disciplines.},

	abstract = {The resolution of cryo-electron tomography can be limited by the first zero of the microscope's contrast transfer function (CTF). To achieve higher resolution, it is critical to determine the \{CTF\} and correct its phase inversions. However, the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the defocus gradient in the projections of tilted specimens make this process challenging. Two programs, \{CTFPLOTTER\} and CTFPHASEFLIP, have been developed to address these issues. \{CTFPLOTTER\} obtains a 1D power spectrum by periodogram averaging and rotational averaging and it estimates the noise background with a novel approach, which uses images taken with no specimen. The background-subtracted 1D power spectra from image regions at different defocus values are then shifted to align their first zeros and averaged together. This averaging improves the \{SNR\} sufficiently that it becomes possible to determine the defocus for subsets of the tilt series rather than just the entire series. \{CTFPHASEFLIP\} corrects images line-by-line by inverting phases appropriately in thin strips of the image at nearly constant defocus. \{CTF\} correction by these methods is shown to improve the resolution of aligned, averaged particles extracted from tomograms. However, some restoration of Fourier amplitudes at high frequencies is important for seeing the benefits from \{CTF\} correction.},

The principle of feature reconstruction is adapted from bounded operators to the unbounded scenario and, in addition, a new situation is examined where the data need to be pre-processed to fit into the mathematical model. In all these cases, invariance and regularization properties are surveyed and established for the example of fractional differentiation. Numerical results confirm the derived characteristics of the presented methods.},

	abstract = {NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the first and largest complex in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. The bovine complex purified from cardiac muscle consists of at least 42 different subunits with a combined molecular mass of about 890 kDa. The three-dimensional structure of the complex was determined at 22 Å from single particles embedded in vitrified ice using electron cryo-microscopy. The structure was calculated using a new program to align particles, to correct for the contrast transfer function of the microscope, and to carry out the three-dimensional reconstruction of the complex. The bovine complex has the overall L-shaped appearance found in earlier studies of the closely related complex I from Neurospora crassa, but it differs by having a thin stalk region linking the membrane-bound globular arm with the intrinsic membrane domain. Thus, the stalk which measures about 30 Å in diameter is likely to contain part of the electron transfer pathway linking the \{NADH\} binding site in the globular arm with the ubiquinone binding site in the membrane domain. The globular domain of bovine complex I is significantly bigger than that of the N. crassa enzyme, suggesting that the apparent additional subunit complexity of the bovine enzyme is associated with the globular part.},

	abstract = {Electron cryotomography (cryoET) has the potential to elucidate the structure of complex biological specimens at molecular resolution but technical and computational improvements are still needed. This work addresses the determination and correction of the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the electron microscope in cryoET. Our approach to \{CTF\} detection and defocus determination depends on strip-based periodogram averaging, extended throughout the tilt series to overcome the low contrast conditions found in cryoET. A method for \{CTF\} correction that deals with the defocus gradient in images of tilted specimens is also proposed. These approaches to \{CTF\} determination and correction have been applied here to several examples of cryoET of pleomorphic specimens and of single particles. \{CTF\} correction is essential for improving the resolution, particularly in those studies that combine cryoET with single particle averaging techniques.},

Based on the concept of approximate inverse, we derive an algorithm of filtered backprojection type which is much faster than the frequently used iterative methods. Numerical tests with simulated and measured transmission electron microscope data and comparisons with other FBP-type methods reveal that our algorithm provides reconstructions with high contrast and resolution, while the noise level is significantly reduced.},
