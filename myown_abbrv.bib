  Abstract                 = {We study single-axis electron tomography and present an improved version of the linear forward model given by Fanelli and {\"{O}}ktem ( 2008 Inverse Problems [/0266-5611/24/1/013001] 24 013001 ) which accounts for inelastic scattering and image distortions caused by imperfect optics. Based on the concept of approximate inverse, we derive an algorithm of filtered backprojection type which is much faster than the frequently used iterative methods. Numerical tests with simulated and measured transmission electron microscope data and comparisons with other FBP-type methods reveal that our algorithm provides reconstructions with high contrast and resolution, while the noise level is significantly reduced.},
